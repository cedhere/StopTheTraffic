    <h2>Human Trafficking is a serious crime.</h2>
    <p>Human trafficking involves using force or fraud to make someone provide labor or services, or to engage in sexual acts. Anyone can be a victim of human trafficking, however, human traffickers tend to target those who are easy targets such as those with economic hardship, lack of a social safety net, emotional vulnerability, and more.</p>
      <p>Perpetrators of this crime can be anyone aswell. Traffickers can be family members, friends, strangers, and partners. Traffickers can come from any background aswell, such as gang members, diplomats, business owners, factory owners, and government workers.</p>
      <p>Victims of human trafficking can be found anywhere, such as resteraunts, hair salons, factories, farms, hotels, and child care/elderly care establishments</p>
      <p>Victims may not speak up or seek help due to language barriers and.or fear of law enforcement. Some victims may not have a lawful immigration status, which causes them to not speak up about the crime. This is what makes human trafficking such a silent crime.</p>

    <p>Human trafficking is so popular because it‚Äôs a low risk, high reward crime. This means that traffickers can get away with the crime easily, and receive a high reward for committing the crime.</p>
    <p>Since many human trafficking victims are vulerable, traffickers will may use fradulent employment oppurtunities or education promises to trick victims into participating in trafficking.</p>
